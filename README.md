# Aotearoa Airborne Pollen Collective (AAPC) Website

Project by **Team Bit by Bit** (Team 15, S1 2024)

Our project will enable the Aotearoa Airborne Pollen Collective (AAPC) to establish an online presence in order to
better inform the general public about the airborn pollen around us in New Zealand. We aim to develop a robust frontend
client that delivers information efficiently and beautifully to the AAPC's end users, as well as providing the researchers
behind the AAPC an intuitive Content Management System (CMS) for them to control the content they provide to their users.

## Clients' Description

> We are a newly established collective that is interested in airborne pollen around us and how climate change may be
affecting the pollen that we are seeing, and its impact on health.
The pollen collective brings together scientists and health professionals interested in pollen and the environment from
around New Zealand.
This is currently a partnership between 3 different Universities and with Auckland Museum.
We hope to grow this collective but to do so we need an online presence of the work that we are doing, so we can attract
public interest and support for our work.
This project aims to develop an online website to showcase our current and future work, and our team, and allow people
to contact us if they are interested. We also want to a place to host the pollen data so the public can search a calendar and see their
pollen data for the day but this may be in a 'freemium' type view

## Project management

This project was developed collaboratively with the help of [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/uoa-compsci399-s1-2024/projects/18), which helped us organize issues by milestones, and clearly laid out a Kanban-style view of our current progress, as well as how our fellow team members were getting along. In addition, GitHub Projects also assisted our team in knowing what issues to prioritize on, and in picking our next tasks.

Our frontend app utilizes Next.js's powerful server-side rendering features to supercharge the user experience, as well as TailwindCSS's
revolutionary approach to styling to provide an efficient yet aesthetically pleasing website.

The backend is implemented with Express.js, with the NoSQL database being hosted on MongoDB Atlas, and authentication / CDN
services being delegated to Amazon Web Services (AWS Cognito & AWS S3).

The entire project is written with TypeScript using strict, type-safe code to ensure type safety and maintainability for future maintainers of the website.


# Project Structure

This repository is a monorepo. Three modules are hosted on this repository - backend, frontend and types.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20^
- npm 10.2.4^

Project dependencies are specified in `package.json` files within each module (frontend, backend, types), and is
managed by npm.

## Frontend
Make sure your working directory is in the frontend module's root directory `/frontend`.

To start the development server:

1. Install all dependencies using `npm i`.
2. Start the Next.js development server using `npm run dev`.
3. The development server should be started on `localhost:3001`.

By default, the app will send API requests defined within `@/app/services` to `localhost:3000`. To configure this, you can change the values defined in `@/app/lib/consts.ts`.

## Backend
Make sure your working directory is in the backend module's root directory `/backend`.

To start the development server:

1. Install all dependencies using `npm i`.
2. Optionally, specify a `.env` environment variables file. By default, the backend will use the `LOCAL` environment and load local services that do not require additional environment variables. Exporting `ENV=DEV` or `ENV=PROD` in `.env` will force the app to run in development or production environment, which uses external services that require additional credentials. Error messages will be helpful to help you determine which services are missing required environment variables.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. The development server should be started on `localhost:3000`.

## Types
This is a static package including data type definitions used by both the frontend and backend services.

To build this package:
1. Install all dependencies using `npm i`.
2. Build the package using `npm run build`.
3. The compiled package should be in `./dist/`.

## Git Structure

- **other branches**: New features are implemented in their own branches. These changes are then merged to `dev` through pull requests.

- `dev`: This branch is automatically deployed to [dev.aapc-nz.org](https://dev.aapc-nz.org/) with development environment credentials, and merged to `main` through pull requests.
- `main`: This branch is automatically deployed to [aapc-nz.org](https://aapc-nz.org/) with production environment credentials.
