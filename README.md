## Project Description

We are a newly established collective that is interested in airborne pollen around us and how climate change may be
affecting the pollen that we are seeing, and its impact on health.
The pollen collective brings together scientists and health professionals interested in pollen and the environment from
around New Zealand.
This is currently a partnership between 3 different Universities and with Auckland Museum.
We hope to grow this collective but to do so we need an online presence of the work that we are doing, so we can attract
public interest and support for our work.
This project aims to develop an online website to showcase our current and future work, and our team, and allow people
to contact us if they are interested. We also want to a place to host the pollen data so the public can search a calendar and see their
pollen data for the day but this may be in a 'freemium' type view
