                My research centres on using pollen to understand the environment in the past. Through extracting
                pollen preserved in ancient sediments, it is possible to work out what the vegetation once was and how
                it has changed in response to events like natural disasters, climate change and human impacts.<br/><br/>
                I am also interested in determining how recent environmental changes are impacting the pollen types
                that are present in the air at different times of the year. This is very important for helping those
                suffering from hay fever and other-pollen related conditions manage their symptoms, and what drives my
                involvement in AAPC.

                        Our shared interest in generating modern airborne pollen data resulted in a collaboration to
                        install an airborne pollen sampler on the roof of the Auckland War Memorial Museum and collect
                        pollen data for one year. This was made possible by the generous cooperation of the AWMM Botany
                        team and operations staff. Amy was able to support this work through her Auckland Medical
                        Research Foundation fellowship, and the University of Auckland PhD Student Laura McDonald (Kai
                        Tahu) was coopted to undertake the pollen counting work, with sisters and fellow UoA students
                        Natasha and Calista Ngadi assisting in operating the airborne sampler.

                    <h2>Our Aims</h2>
                    <h3>Health</h3>
                    <p>
                        AAPCâ€™s aim is to better understand how airborne pollen levels vary through time and what the
                        implications are for sufferers of eye conditions and allergic respiratory diseases. By building
                        a long-term record of pollen variation through the year, our health researchers will be able to
                        look for relationships between pollen levels and occurrences of eye and respiratory conditions
                        to better understand causative relationships. Knowing which pollen is connected with periods of
                        increased symptoms and when helps to inform diagnoses and treatments for patients.
                        <br />

                    </p>
                    <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, building a picture of the long-term variation in pollen levels can help us
                        understand how environmental processes like climate variability and climate change might impact
                        pollen levels in the future. This will, in turn, help decision-makers plan to ensure that the
                        health system has the capacity to deal with changes in pollen-related conditions in the future.
                        This contributes to making our communities more resilient in the face of climate change.

                    <p>
                        We are focusing on Tamaki Makaurau as it is our most populous city and has a high concentration
                        of people who suffer from hay fever and other respiratory and ophthalmologic conditions. But it
                        is our hope to eventually be able to expand our work to other centres in Aotearoa.

                        These organisations are backing AAPC and are providing the tools, technologies and support to
                        continue research into pollen.
