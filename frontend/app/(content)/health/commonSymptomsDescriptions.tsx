                Allergy-causing substances like pollen and dander may cause dilatation of blood vessels in the
                conjunctiva, the membrane covering the eye. The resulting reddening of the eyes is called allergic
                conjunctivitis, and is usually accompanied by itching and tearing.

                Pollen inhalation can provoke allergic reactions, causing throat irritation, itching, and soreness.
                <br />
                This discomfort may escalate to swelling and inflammation in throat tissues. Excessive mucus production
                can lead to postnasal drip, exacerbating throat irritation and coughing. Pollen exposure can worsen
                respiratory symptoms in asthma sufferers. Long-term exposure may result in complications such as throat
                infections.
