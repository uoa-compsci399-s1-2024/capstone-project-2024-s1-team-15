![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

This package contains static type definitions for useful data structures found in both the frontend and backend apps. It is automatically published to npm when changes are made in the `dev` branch.

You can find the type definitions on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-s1-2024/capstone-project-2024-s1-team-15/wiki) of this repository.

You can install this package using `npm`:

```bash
npm install @aapc/types
```

When merging changes in this package to `dev`, it should be noted that the version specified in [package.json](package.json)
needs to be bumped manually, or else publishing to npm would fail.
